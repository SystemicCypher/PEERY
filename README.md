# PeerCoin
### A peer-to-peer file sharing/cryptocurrency framework built on a blockchain
PeerCoin will be a secure way to share data with others. The more peercoins you have, the more you can send and recieve.
Every file sharing operation requires coins to change hands, that is, if Alice wants a file Bob has, Alice has to have enough coins to
fund the transfer of files. As confirmation of the file's arrival, Bob recieves some coins. If several people in the network have the file, 
coins will be distributed to all who send a piece to the requester.
### To run:
Currently, all that exists in main.cpp is an RSA encryption check, to test if the RSA encryption library I wrote works.
TO MAKE: go to the src folder in a terminal and type make
That should compile all that is there right now
